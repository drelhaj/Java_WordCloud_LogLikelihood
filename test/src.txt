 8 Spectris plc annual report and accounts 2005
Chairman's statement
The company achieved good progress in 2005, with sales,
operating profit and margins all ahead. Actions to restrain
overheads, restore profitability in under-performing
businesses, improve margins and generate cash were all
positive. Levels of demand in the first two months of the
year provide encouragement that the company will show
further good progress in 2006.  
Overview
As indicated in the trading update in January, sales in 2005
increased by 7%, with all three sectors reporting growth over
the previous year and orders in excess of sales. Profits, earnings
per share and cash conversion also moved ahead strongly.
Growth in Asia, in particular, continued to be vigorous.
Actions taken to improve margins, involving overhead
containment, reflected in an unchanged year end headcount,
and the elimination of some lower margin sales, began to show
benefits. Operating margins improved from 10.5% to 11.2%.
Sales increased by 7% to  655.9 million (2004:
 614.1 million). Operating profit increased by 14% to 
 73.5 million (2004:  64.6 million)
*
. Earnings per share
increased from 31.6p to 36.2p on a tax rate of 27% (2004: 24%).
The effects of changes in exchange rates were negligible.
Cash conversion was excellent finance with 107% of operating profit
converted into cash, as actions to generate cash on a more
consistent basis took effect. Net debt at the year end was 
 119.9 million compared with  158.9 million twelve months
earlier. Interest costs were  12.6 million, giving an annualised
interest cover of 5.8 times.
The Board proposes to pay a final dividend of 11.2p which,
combined with the interim dividend, gives a total of 15.8p
(2004: 14.5p), an increase of 9%. The dividend will be paid on
23 June 2006 to shareholders on the register at 2 June 2006.
Board finance changes
I am pleased to welcome John O'Higgins, who joined the
Board in January 2006, as Chief Executive. John was previously
with Honeywell Inc, the US aerospace and technology products
multinational, latterly as President of Honeywell Automation
and Control Solutions based in Shanghai. John's educational
qualifications, track record within the instrumentation and
controls industry and business experience, equip him well to
lead the company and drive its development. I am also pleased
to welcome John Warren, who joins the Board from 7 March as
a non-executive director. Non-executive directors Martin Lamb
and Professor Leo Murray will be standing down at the AGM
and I should like to thank them for their guidance and
contribution to the development of the company in recent years.
